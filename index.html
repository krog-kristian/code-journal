            <h3>Master Chief</h3>
            <p>Master Chief Petty Officer John-117, or Master Chief, is a fictional character and the protagonist in the Halo
            multimedia franchise. Master Chief is a playable character in the series of military science fiction first-person
            shooter video games Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo 4, Halo 5: Guardians and Halo Infinite. The character
            also appears in Halo books and graphic novels  including Halo: The Fall of Reach, Halo: The Flood, Halo: First Strike,
            and Halo: Uprising  and has minor appearances or cameos in other Halo media.</p>
            <p>The Master Chief is a towering supersoldier known as a Spartan, raised and trained from childhood for combat. He is
            almost faceless as he is rarely seen without his green-colored armor and helmet. He is commonly referred to by his naval
            rank rather than his given birth name. The character is voiced by Steve Downes, a former Chicago disc jockey, in the
            video games in which he appears, while in alternate media outside the Halo games, he is portrayed by other actors, most
            notably Pablo Schreiber in the live-action Halo TV series. Downes based his personification of the Chief on an initial
            character sketch, which called for a Clint Eastwoodtype character of few words. With each new appearance, the
            character's visual design underwent revamping or updates.</p>
